Arduino Board: An Arduino Uno or Nano.

Stepper Motors: Two NEMA 17 stepper motors for the X and Y axes.<br>

Motor Drivers: L293D ICs or similar to control the stepper motors.<br>

Servo Motor: A small servo motor (e.g., Tower Pro MG996R) for the Z-axis to lift and lower the pen.<br>

Rails and Pulleys: Use DVD/CD drive rails for the X and Y axes.<br>

Pen Holder: A simple pen holder to hold the drawing pen.<br>

Power Supply: A suitable power supply for the motors and Arduino.<br>

Breadboard and Jumper Wires: For prototyping before final assembly.<br>

3D Printed Parts: Optional, but can help with stability and precision.<br>

Timing Belt: GT2 belt for smooth movement.<br>

Linear Bearings: MGN15H linear rails and corresponding sliding blocks.<br>
